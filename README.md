# LinkedIn_data_parser
Linked in parser, using selenium
Please in order to use this program, have python last version installed
And also use pip packet installer to instal:
  pip install os-sys
  pip install selenium
  pip install pandas
  pip install webdriver-manager
 
 Please be sure that OS is not overloaded and internet speed is enough, program needs to be upgraded
 In case or error "element not dound/ not interactable" please re-run program and it should work, that happens because the DOM element is not loaded on the page
 Soon this issue will be fixed with WebDriver.wait, as soon as i figure out, for now it makes no sense, so please be calm ;)
